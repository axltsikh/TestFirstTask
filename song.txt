You woke up this morning
Got yourself a gun,
Mama always said you'd be
The Chosen One.
She said: You're one in a million
You've got to burn to shine,
But you were born under a bad sign,
With a blue moon in your eyes.
You woke up this morning
All the love has gone,
Your Papa never told you
About right and wrong.
But you're looking good, baby,
I believe you're feeling fine, (shame about it),
Born under a bad sign
With a blue moon in your eyes.
You woke up this morning
The world turned upside down,
Thing's ain't been the same
Since the Blues walked into town.
But you're one in a million
You've got that shotgun shine.
Born under a bad sign,
With a blue moon in your eyes.
When you woke up this morning everything you had was
Gone. By half past ten your head was going ding-dong.
Ringing like a bell from your head down to your toes,
Like a voice telling you there was something you should
Know. Last night you were flying but today you're so low
Ain't it times like these that make you wonder if
You'll ever know the meaning of things as they appear to
The others; wives, mothers, fathers, sisters and
Brothers. Don't you wish you didn't function, wish you
Didn't think beyond the next paycheck and the next little
Drink' Well you do so make up your mind to go on, 'cos
When you woke up this morning everything you had was gone.
When ya woke up this mornin'
Woke up this mornin'
Ya, woke up this mornin'
Woke up this mornin', you wanna be
You wanna be the chosen one
(Yeah, you know what you're talkin' about)
You just can't help yourself, yeah
Woke up this mornin'
When ya, woke up this mornin'
(Woke up this mornin')
(Woke up this mornin')
Woke up this mornin' and
(My dreams gone bad)
Got yourself a gun (gotta hold, a-wind yourself up)
A-got yourself a gun
Got yourself a gun.
Got yourself a gun.
Got yourself a gun.
Got yourself a gun...
